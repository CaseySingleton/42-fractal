# 42-fractal

Purpose/requirements:
- Create a visual representation of a few fractals
- Fractals must have multiple colors to give a feeling of depth
- Must be able to zoom in and out of the fractal using the mouse wheel
- Zoom must be centered on the mouse cursor
- Must be able to navigate the fractal using keys
- Must contain Mandelbrot, Julia, and one extra fractal
- Julia fractal must change shape based on mouse cursor position
- And of course, no leaks

What I learned (so much!):
- How to translate a complex plane onto an XWindow (for XWindows the top left corner is treated as (0,0)
where as for a complex plane (0,0) is the center of the window)
