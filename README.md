# 42-fractal

Purpose/requirements:
- Create a visual representation of a few fractals
- Fractals must have multiple colors to give a feeling of depth
- Must be able to zoom in and out of the fractal using the mouse wheel
- Zoom must be centered on the mouse cursor
- Must be able to navigate the fractal using keys
- Must contain Mandelbrot, Julia, and one extra fractal
- Julia fractal must change shape based on mouse cursor position
- And of course, no leaks

What I learned (so much!):
- How to translate a complex plane onto an XWindow (for XWindows the top left corner is treated as (0,0)
where as for a complex plane (0,0) is the center of the window)
- How to scale or 'flatten' a resolution to workable numbers ie. 800x800 where is treated as 4x4
- What exactly a fractal is and how they work
- How to add and use color based on some sort of number returned!
- A more in-depth understanding of how key hooks and event hooks work. Including how to set up my own custom hooks!
- Most importantly, I leanred that even if you have NO IDEA what you are tring do accomplish, with a few days of research, a lot of coffee, and a good basic design plan you can program anything

Overall this has been my favorite project so far. It was the most I have been taken out of my comfort zone (as far as programming goes), and after long hours of work I have a working program that I am very proud of.
